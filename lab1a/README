Included files: 
1. lab1a.c: Set the the keyboard to non-canonical input mode, and allow to read input from keyboard to a buffer,
then write the received characters back out to the display. The program also support --shell argument (in child process),
and a new process is made. With these support, we can pass input/output between the terminal and a shell using two pipes.
In the Child process (shell), we can run the commands that is received from the read end of to_child_pipe (from terminal 
to shell), and its write to stdard out or standard error, the write end of to_parent_pipe. In the parent process (terminal),
we get input from stdin or shell, and write the stdout or forward to shell. Here, we use the poll() to  wait for the first
of multiple input sources (stdin or input from shell).

2. Makefile: this support the standard default, clean and dist targets.

3. README
