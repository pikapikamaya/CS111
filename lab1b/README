Include files:
1. lab1b-client.c: takes three options, --port=port#, --log=filename, and --compress.
The client program will send input from the keyboard to socket and input from the socket to display.
When the log option is specified, it will write the data written to or read from the server to the
specified log file. When the compress option is specified, it will compress the data before sending
it over the network and decompress it after receiving.

2. lab1b-server.c: takes two options,  --port=port#, and --compress.
It will connect to the client and send the command received from the client to the shell, and will
serve the client program. 

3. Makefile: this included the -lz flag to do the deflate and inflate.

4. README
